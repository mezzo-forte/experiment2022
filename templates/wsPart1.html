<p><b>Social model description - Stage 1</b></p>
    <br>

<p>► You are a member of the society of {{ group_size }} individuals where everyone is engaged in three types of work: paid-work, unpaid-work or no work. Paid work generates income.
<br>► Each member in the group would be randomly assigned some level of initial endowment ranging anywhere between € {{ lower_range }} to € {{ upper_range }}, but you would only come to know about this at the end of the first part (i.e., after 12 tasks are completed).
<br>► All members of the society who take up paid work receive a subsidy (<b>s</b>) of € {{ subsidy_rate_WS }} according to tasks completed (<b>h</b>) and constant wage rate (<b>w</b>) of € {{ wage_rate }} per month from the state each month without any exceptions <b>dependent</b> on their income from the paid work.
<br>► You have 1 month of possible working time (1 month = 1 task, 12 tasks = 1 year). You can decide how to spend this time between available work types.
<br>► The poverty threshhold is 15%, meaning, income below € 153 is not taxed, while income over € 153 would be taxed with a flat tax rate (<b>t</b>) of {{ tax_rate }}. Thus, your overall gross (NOT inclusive of tax) income can be described by the following formula:
<br> <img src="{{ url_for ('static', filename='assets/WS_Income_Endowment.png')}}">
<br>That is, if you take up paid work, your gross income (in EUR) will look as follows for one task period (rememeber, you have been assigned some level of endowment (E) but it hasn't been revealed yet):
<br><i>Gross income = € E + (200*(1+0.50)) = € E + 300</i>
<br>Remember: Real EUR 1 = Experiment EUR 1000 
<br><br>
<br>► The tasks include engaging in ONE of the three types of work types:
<br>1) Paid Work: involves solving a simple math task (ex. 21*16=?) (only successful solving of the task would be rewarded with income). You receive income points <b>only</b> for correctly solved tasks.
<br>2) Unpaid Work: involves playing trivia(quiz) and learning something new. You do not get income points for this type of task.
<br>3) No work: involves reading memes (comics). You do not get income points for this type of task.
